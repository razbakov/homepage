Creating an agent means creating a `.cursorrules` file. JSON probably works the best. I also tried markdown, but results were not that good.

Limiting agent's role lets you both focus on a topic, most importantly you.
You need to be expert to be faster, you need to know terminology.

Agent will help you to create that JSON file, you just need to ask it to do so. You can also create trigger-words (aliases to do something), for example:

- "save" - create git commit with a good git commit message
- "learn" - create a new script using API
- "rule" - add a rule to cursorrules

For agents important:

- specific role (focus)
- memory (docs)
- documents structure/architecture
- skills (tools it can use and how)
- communication protocol

So multiple agents means multiple repositories, each one describing it's agent role, knowledge, memory, skills and communication protocol.

Creating agents, is like working in HR department. You need to create culture. You need to define the job description. You need to interview and align on goals. You need to onboard (show your processes and preferences). Setup environment (document structure, templates, navigation). Do regular reviews.

For HR to be able to onboard someone, they need CEO to provide with mission, vision, strategy and objectives. Define the "WHY" first. The best way to do it is using Sociocracy 3.0 framework and OKRs. Download all relavant documentation and examples and save it markdown files. Create index document with links to those files, and explanations what's there, provide tags.

Start with documentation in markdown, when content structure and copy is ready and you are happy with it, then go to next steps.

Create tasks (epics, user stories, bugs). This way you'll be able to track progress.

Apply design thinking, behavior driven development and test driver development. Create tests first. Create hypothesis. Create concept. Define problem first. You need to think about use cases, the different paths something will be used. About the limitations, special cases, etc.

Don't jump into implementation until you are happy with the content and structure. Once at implementation stage, start simple first. Get all your structure visualized and shaped. Then get to minimal design. Then start iterating on effects.

You need to take the role of a good parent and leader. The AI agent will want always to jump into implementation. You don't have to. Don't tell agent what to do, tell what's the problem, tell why you need it. Don't suggest solutions. Keep solutions for yourself, if you need it, you can still use it for later iterations if you didn't like what AI offered.

You can control behavior of the AI agent like with a dog: after agent gave you result you say can choose how to react:

- looks great? - "good boy, attaboy"
- something feels weird? - be sarcastic, or ask questions - "are you sure it's good?" - AI will step back and look back. you can also get emotional, you can scream "STOP! WHAT ARE YOU DOOOING?", you can cry with emojies, you can swear. you can express your feelings, not necessary to say what exactly to do.
- not satisfied? - "try harder"
- want to see other possible solutions - "don't change the code. think. show me 10 alternatives"
- let agent decide for you - "what would you chose? why?"
- if something is wrong, you just need to describe it your way, or copy paste error, or make a screenshot and send it.
- sometimes agent halucinate and do something very strange, in that case you can show how would you do it, start doing it and let it continue. or point finger at the specific context (file, aspect, etc.).
- sometimes agent will change something that's not linked to what you asked. it can delete something. that's your work - quality control, review.
- sometimes agent won't follow your rules. that's your work - adjust communication protocol. you need to run diagnostics and ask it why that happened and what needs to be changed to avoid that in the future.

Conversating more with AI, you will develop the intuition, what it gets, how its "brains" work and feeling how to be more productive and what else is possible.

When you use git, you create a multiverse, and you can jump back to any decision and create an alternate universe. If you need more creativity you don't have to follow this plan, jump to any point.

Every new setup done even a bit different will produce different result. That's gift and a curse. Be aware. Stay alarm.
