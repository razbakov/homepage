Built on top of the powerful Cursor IDE, it offers a suite of intelligent experts ready to assist with various aspects of your business. This project builds upon the principles outlined in our [Building Effective Multi-Agent AI Systems](/blog/2025-01-08-multi-agent) guide and implements them using the [Architect framework](/blog/2025-01-09-architect-ai-framework).

- Teams transitioning to AI-first workflows
- Organizations wanting to reduce administrative overhead
- Anyone seeking a more intelligent way to manage projects

## 📚 Best Practices

I have the following rules working with Cursor AI:

1. One task - once conversation, to ensure context is not too big.
2. Before starting working on tasks, I create [documentation about the organization](https://sociocracy30.org/common-sense-framework/) and [defining goals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJB83EZtAjc).
3. Before jumping into implementation, I ask for documentation - [Readme Driven Development](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html).
4. During implementation, I use [6 thinking hats](/blog/2018-05-16-thinking-hats), sometimes I agree, sometimes I let my emotions react, sometimes I am writing sarcastic comments and it gets it.
5. After each successful small step (accepting the answers) I do [git commit](https://github.blog/developer-skills/programming-languages-and-frameworks/what-is-git-our-beginners-guide-to-version-control/), so that I can try out crazy ideas in the next prompt.
6. After task is done I ask it to update documentation and [cross-reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-reference) it.
7. In the end I ask it go through our conversation and update rules to define our new jargon/aliases (short commands instead of long prompts, i.e. “save” means create commit message and run commit)
