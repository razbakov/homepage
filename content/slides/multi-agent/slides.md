# Setup Guide

### Basic Implementation

1. **Create Agent Configuration**

   ```json
   {
     "roles": {
       "TechLead": {
         "expertise": ["architecture", "code review"],
         "responsibilities": ["technical planning"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Define Communication Patterns**
   - Problem-first approach
   - Clear command structure
   - Feedback mechanisms

# Communication Best Practices

### Effective Interaction

1. **Problem-First Approach**

   - Describe problems, not solutions
   - Explain the "why"
   - Allow agent proposals

2. **Feedback Loop**
   - Positive reinforcement
   - Constructive criticism
   - Iteration requests

---

# Quality Control System

### Maintaining Excellence

1. **Regular Reviews**

   - Monitor outputs
   - Verify alignment
   - Check for issues

2. **Version Control**
   - Decision checkpoints
   - Alternative approaches
   - Implementation tracking
